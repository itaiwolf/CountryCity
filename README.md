How to Play
Create or Join a Game:

Hosts can create a game and share a game code for others to join.
Players can join an existing game by entering a valid game code.
Category Selection:

The host must choose at least 9 categories. These can be selected manually, or the game can automatically choose random or classic categories.
Game Rounds:

At the start of each round, a random letter is chosen, and players must fill in the categories with words starting with that letter.
The faster and more unique your answers, the better your score.

Development
The game is currently under development, and we're continuously adding new features to improve the experience.

Future Roadmap
AI Assistance: Implementing an AI feature that checks unknown words through an external API (ChatGPT). If the word is valid, it will be automatically added to the game’s database for future use.
Caching: Plan to implement a caching system to optimize frequently used data and improve game performance.
Enhanced User Experience: Further work will be done on the design to make it more engaging, interactive, and visually appealing.
